# Breadth-First-Search-Example

### Created as a project for CS3050

Given a number of floors in a building, a starting floor, a goal floor, a number of floors you can go up, and a number of floors you can go down, this program will find the shortest path from the starting floor to the goal floor if there is one, or will output "Use the stairs" if there is not.

It does this using a breath-first search.
